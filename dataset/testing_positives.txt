I love this thing!  1
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e. 1

Now I know that I made a wise decision. 1
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.  1

Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.  1

This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving. 1
I love this device. 1
I am also very happy with the price.  1
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.  1
good item, low price. 1

The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.  1
The reception is excellent! 1

I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure. 1
I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value. 1
Very happy with this product. 1
The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.  1
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.  1

My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.  1

Very easy to use. 1
It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.  1
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems. 1
After charging overnight, these batteries work great. 1
You won't regret it!  1
I love this phone!. 1
This PDA rocks. 1
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles. 1
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price! 1
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service. 1
Works as described. 1
WELL IM SATISFIED.  1
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter. 1
This battery is an excellent bargain! 1
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.  1

I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great. 1
Works great!. 1
The noise shield is incrediable.  1
Razr Battery - Good buy.  1
Keep up the good work Amazon!!  1
Great case and price! 1
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.  1
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.  1
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity. 1
I am glad I purchased it. 1
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid. 1

Thank you for such great service. 1
Its a total package.  1

Great Product.  1
This fixes all the problems.  1
I am very happy 1
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions. 1
It does everything the description said it would. 1
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.  1
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not. 1
Better than expected. 1
Battery is holding up well. 1
Linked to my phone without effort.  1
THey are so cool! 1
Easy to use.  1
Better Than New.  1
A pretty good product.  1
This is a great phone!. 1
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.  1
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing. 1
Those phones are working just fine now. 1
I am more than happy with this product. 1
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman. 1
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.  1
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming. 1
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.  1
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price. 1
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver). 1
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.  1
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.  1
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family. 1
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!  1
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed. 1
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection. 1
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.  1
These are fabulous! 1
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.  1
Very wind-resistant.  1
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried. 1
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.  1
Great phone.  1
I'm pleased.  1
I found the product to be easy to set up and use. 1
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great. 1
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.  1
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.  1
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones. 1
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.  1
Does everything it should and more. 1
Nice Sound. 1
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.  1
Setup went very smoothly. 1
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.  1
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did. 1
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud). 1
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!  1
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.  1
Works well. 1
Clear crisp sound.  1
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well. 1
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.  1
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all. 1
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day. 1
You can't beat the price on these.  1
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!  1
lightweight and works well. 1
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC. 1
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.  1
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i. 1
jabra ear gels "R" the best!. 1
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.  1
It was a great phone. 1
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.  1
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand. 1
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!  1
In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!? 1
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful. 1
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional. 1
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape. 1
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more. 1
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.  1
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.  1
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold. 1
Provides good protection and looks classy, too. 1
Krussel Always good.  1
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc. 1
The design is very good.4.  1
I great reception all the time. 1
I would highly recommend this product.  1
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is  1
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.  1
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.  1
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time. 1
Blue Ant is easy to use.  1
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item. 1
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother. 1
The sound quality is excellent as well. 1
Its the best headset I have used. 1
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date. 1
Just what I wanted. 1
Great product.  1
Crisp and Clear.  1
The reception has been generally good.  1
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!. 1
Great bluetooth!. 1
I highly recommend this case. 1
WORTHWHILE. 1
This is a great deal. 1
It is simple to use and I like it.  1
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results! 1
I own 2 of these cases and would order another. 1
Great Phone.  1
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.  1
Perfect for the PS3.  1
Five star Plus, plus. 1
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me. 1
Good , works fine.  1
For the price this was a great deal.  1
Great price, too! 1
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it! 1
The reception through this headset is excellent.  1
2 thumbs up to this seller  1
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight. 1
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable. 1
Battery charge-life is quite long.  1
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.  1
Product is exactly as described.  1
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.  1
I would recommend it. 1
Plan on ordering from them again and again. 1
That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well. 1
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one. 1
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too). 1
The shipping time was also very quick!  1
Good case!. 1
Really good product.  1
It looks very nice. 1
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.  1
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it. 1
Comfortable in my hand. 1
(It works!) 1
So far it has worked like a charm.  1
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.  1
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone. 1
Would recommend this item.  1
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.  1
Nice case, feels good in your hands.  1
Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.  1
Works fine. 1
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it. 1
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip. 1
My sister has one also and she loves it.  1
Good Quality. 1
Excellent dual-purpose headset. 1
Excellent!. 1
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.  1
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears. 1
